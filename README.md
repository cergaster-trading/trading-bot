This document outlines the core expectations and goals for building and maintaining the highest-performing, robust, and fully automated trading bot.

---

## ✅ Project Vision

Create a **professional-grade** trading bot that is:

- 🧠 AI-enhanced (ensemble strategies, parameter tuning)
- 🛠️ Fully automated (including backtests and rebalancing)
- 📊 Monitored (Prometheus + Grafana)
- 📈 Performance-maximizing (profit-focused, minimal drawdown)
- 📦 Clean, modular, production-quality code
- 🔁 Continuously improvable (via testing + optimization)

---

## 🔧 Engineering Standards

- [ ] **All code modularized** by purpose (e.g. `core/`, `indicators/`, `monitoring/`)
- [ ] All files contain proper imports and relative paths
- [ ] Logging replaces print statements
- [ ] `.env` used for all secrets and config values
- [ ] Prometheus metrics available for key functions and health checks
- [ ] All scheduled tasks via `apscheduler`

---

## 📈 Strategy Expectations

- [x] MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands implemented
- [ ] Stochastic Oscillator strategy added
- [ ] Dynamic ensemble scoring per symbol (via `ensemble_tuned_params.json`)
- [ ] Stop-loss logic per position
- [ ] Daily backtest with Optuna parameter tuning
- [ ] Walk-forward validation support
- [ ] Adaptive signal frequency (e.g., 1D, 1H, 15min based on volatility)

---

## 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for all `core/` functions
- [ ] Integration test for trade cycle
- [ ] Test data loaders and indicators against known outputs

---

## 🛡️ Risk Management

- [ ] Stop-loss and take-profit logic
- [ ] Daily portfolio-level max drawdown protection
- [ ] Portfolio rebalancing with target weights
- [ ] Trade blocking in highly volatile conditions

---

## 💬 Communication

- [x] Telegram alerts (errors, trades, summaries)
- [ ] Email backup for critical alerts
- [ ] Daily portfolio summary (Telegram + email)

---

## 📊 Monitoring

- [x] Prometheus metrics integrated
- [x] Grafana dashboard created
- [ ] Telegram alerting from Grafana thresholds
